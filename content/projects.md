## New teachers' induction support systems

<img src="/images/transition.jpg" align="left" style="padding: 10px;" width="240" alt="People walking down a dark hallway">

New teachers face numerous decisions as they transition from teacher preparation into enacting practice (i.e., their induction period). They must reconcile conflicting messages about what and how to teach from the academic world of the preparation program and the practical world of their school of employment. Interviews with new teachers provide evidence of why new teachers seek supports for professional leaning to complement formal induction programs offered by schools and districts. Findings demonstrate how new teachers’ agency is stretched as they navigate the edu-verse, a complex learning ecology of supports accessed locally and through social media.

## Educators as data scientists

<img src="/images/data.png" align="left" style="padding: 10px;" width="240" alt="Multicolored programming code displayed on a computer screen">

Data science and learning analytics in education are useful, but we have limited information about the effectiveness or recommendations to guide the design of learning opportunities for professionals working in education. At the same time, we know that, in general, well-designed learning opportunities, even those brief in duration, can improve computational skills. Our purpose is to explore the design and effects of data science workshops for educational researchers.
