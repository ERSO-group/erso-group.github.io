We are the *Educational Research into the Social and Online* (**ERSO**) group, a research team gathered and led by [Dr. Bret Staudt Willet] and [Dr. Secil Caskurlu]. We are based in the Instructional Systems and Learning Technologies ([ISLT]) program at Florida State University, but our contributors and collaborators are global in scope.

Broadly, our research investigates self-directed learning, especially by teachers. This focus covers areas including:

- Networked learning in online communities, such as those hosted by Twitter and Reddit.
- Factors that impact student outcomes and how to integrate them into the design, development, and evaluation of learning environments, experiences, and technologies.
- New teachers' induction support systems.
- Teachers' computational-thinking competencies.
- Educators as data scientists.
- Educators' informal learning and invisible labor.

We appreciate that you're here, visiting our digital home. While you're here, check out some of our [projects] and the latest [news]. We'd also love for you to connect with us on Twitter at [@ERSOgroup] or by [email].

Let's work on something together soon!
