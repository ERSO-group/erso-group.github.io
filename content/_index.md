We are the *Educational Research into the Social and Online* (**ERSO**) group, a research team gathered and led by [Dr. Bret Staudt Willet]. We are based in the Instructional Systems and Learning Technologies ([ISLT]) program at Florida State University, but our contributors and collaborators are global in scope.

We appreciate that you're here, visiting our digital home. While you're here, check out some of our [projects] and the latest [news]. We'd also love for you to connect with us on Twitter at [@ERSOgroup] or by [email].

Let's work on something together soon!
