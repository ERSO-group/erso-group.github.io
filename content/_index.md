We are the *Educational Research into the Social and Online* (**ERSO**) group, a research team gathered and led by [Dr. Bret Staudt Willet] and [Dr. Secil Caskurlu]. We are based in the Instructional Systems and Learning Technologies ([ISLT]) program at Florida State University, but our contributors and collaborators are global in scope.

Broadly, our research investigates self-directed learning, especially by teachers. This focus covers areas including:

- Networked learning in online communities, such as those hosted by Twitter and Reddit.
- Factors that impact student outcomes and how to integrate them into the design, development, and evaluation of learning environments, experiences, and technologies.
- New teachers' induction support systems.
- Teachers' computational-thinking competencies.
- Educators as data scientists.
- Educators' informal learning and invisible labor.

We appreciate that you're here, visiting our digital home. While you're here, check out some of our [projects] and the latest [news]. We'd also love for you to connect with us on Twitter at [@ERSOgroup] or by [email].

Let's work on something together soon!

## Land Acknowledgement

### We Honor Native Land

We live and work in Tallahassee, Florida, on the traditional land of the Apalachee, Muscogee, and Miccosukee Peoples. We share this land acknowledgement to demonstrate our commitment to learning and working to dismantle the ongoing legacies of settler colonialism. 

We recognize that this land remains scarred by the histories and ongoing legacies of settler colonial violence, dispossession, and removal. In spite of all of this, and with tremendous resilience, these Indigenous Nations have remained deeply connected to this territory, to their families, to their communities, and to their cultural ways of life. We recognize the ongoing relationships of care that these Indigenous Nations maintain with this land and extend our gratitude as we live and work as humble and respectful guests upon their territory. 

We encourage you to learn about and amplify the contemporary work of the Indigenous nations whose land you are on and to endeavor to support Indigenous sovereignty in all the ways that you can. To start learning, we have found the [Native Land map] to be fascinating to explore, and the [Honor Native Land guide] from the U.S. Department of Arts & Culture has many useful resources. Finally, if you are in the Tallahassee area, you may find this [list of resources from the Decolonize FSU group] to be helpful.
