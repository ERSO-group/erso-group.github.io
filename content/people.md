I am an Assistant Professor of Instructional Systems & Learning Technologies at Florida State University.

My research investigates **self-directed learning**, especially by teachers. I'm most interested in what happens when our students, learners, and trainees finish the instruction and training we design for them. What do they do *after* they walk out the door or log off? How do they continue to develop the knowledge, skills, and abilities they need? Where do they look for resources? Who do they talk to?

I have several ongoing projects on self-directed learning. First, I examine networked learning in online communities, such as those hosted by Twitter and Reddit. Second, I study how new teachers expand their professional support systems during their induction transition. Third, I seek to understand educators' experiences as data scientists. Fourth, I interrogate educators' informal learning as a form of invisible labor.

I am an Assistant Professor of Instructional Systems & Learning Technologies at Florida State University.

My main research interest focuses on the factors that impact student outcomes and how to integrate them into the design, development and evaluation phases as they relate to learning environments, experiences, technologies and the like. My second research interest focuses on the application of learning principles derived from learning sciences to online teaching and learning, and their impacts on student outcomes. Specifically, I investigate the relationships between inputs (e.g., evidence-based instructional strategies) and outputs (e.g., student satisfaction and actual learning). Finally, I am interested in integrating computational thinking into K-12 education. More specifically, I am interested in teacher competencies required for meaningful integration of computational thinking into K-12 to foster student outcomes while they are engaged in computational thinking-related tasks.
