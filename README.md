Broadly, our research investigates self-directed learning, especially by teachers. This focus covers areas including:

- Networked learning in online communities, such as those hosted by Twitter and Reddit.
- Factors that impact student outcomes and how to integrate them into the design, development, and evaluation of learning environments, experiences, and technologies.
- New teachers' induction support systems.
- Teachers' computational-thinking competencies.
- Educators as data scientists.
- Educators' informal learning and invisible labor.
